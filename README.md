# HiveTech Innovations - BINF 4900
HiveTech Innovations is a hypothetical company with the intention of Building a Better Bee. We researched and presented our findings on how we would be able to do this by selectively breeding bees to make a more resistant hardier bee.

In this course, Wes Huneycutt (CEO), Sabrina Pinard (CTO), and Catherine Cheedle (CFO) all collaborated together to bring this startup in front of real Venture Capitalists.
