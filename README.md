# HiveTech Innovations - BINF 4900
HiveTech Innovations is a hypothetical company with the intention of Building a Better Bee. We researched and presented our findings on how we would be able to do this by selectively breeding bees to make a more resistant hardier bee.

Thoughout the semester, I created a general layout of powerpoint slides and put customer discovery slides together, an example of an ad we would release, and the company logo.

In this course, Wes Huneycutt (CEO), Sabrina Pinard (CTO), and Catherine Cheedle (CFO) all collaborated together to bring this startup in front of real Venture Capitalists.
